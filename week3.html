        <h4>Hack The Throne</h4>
        <p>Dear Juniors, Welcome to our first ever comfortable, most relaxed, sit back and enjoy,"THE GREAT VA-HACK THE THRONE".</p>

        <p>People usually think of playing the game of thrones, beeing the computer scientist, let's try and hack the throne. Without wasting any time lets dive in.</p>
        
        <p>Your task is to create a web page using whatever you have learned so far and in the most creative way possible whereby we have a picture preferably but not necessarily of you and a small description about your self, who are you? what are your skills? what do you love to do? etc. This webpage when I see as an unknown person, it should introduced me to all 5 of you digitally. You are free to design your content, present your ideas in the way that you like.</p>
        
        <p>4 Things to keep in mind when designing and implementing webpage:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Use of git and Github to be in sync. also please use Vscode to write your code.</li>
          <li>Using HTML, CSS and materialize CSS.</li>
          <li>Taking care of all the web3c semantics.</li>
          <li>use of the same repo with different branches if necessary on Github.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/bharat029/VAHackTheThrone/">This</a> is the repository you will be using to colaborate.</p>

        <p>The time to finish the task would be 1 hour. we start at 7.30 pm sharp and stop at 8.30.</p>
        
        
        <p>We hope you all have a fun-loving learning experience where our motto is to teach and to learn. Please remember this,"You are a team, your success, and your failure should come out as a team and not an individual".</p>
        
        <blockquote>We succeed when we help others succeed.</blockquote>
